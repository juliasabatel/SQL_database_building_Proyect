# SQL_database_building_Proyecto

Database project

This is the second project, the objective of which is the construction of a database. Starting from six CSV files we will start cleaning, exploring and structuring the information. 
Python and SQL will be used.

GOALS

🧹 Cleaning of the six databases.

👀 Exploration of the databases.

📝 Database Construction

⚙️ Development of queries and new information added.

STEP BY STEP

🧽 Databases cleanup

The first step we have carried out has been the Python cleanup of the databases. These have been done with a scan of each one and then an analysis of null values, duplicates, misspellings etc ....
The uppercase and lowercase letters of the columns have been modified with their correction.
Columns that did not provide information and were irrelevant for the analysis have been eliminated.

🔥 Export to SQL

This step starts with the export to SQL of the databases previously cleaned in Python. Once inside we name each column of the tables by its variable type and then move on to create the relationship type.

⚡️ Establishing relationships 

 We carry out the establishment of relationships, this is done in SQL. Attached below is a graphic in which they can be clearly seen.

🌪 Synchronization with Python and SQL 

We update and synchronize with Python and SQL to check that there is no error and we can go ahead with the process.
Once the process is done we move on to perform the queries.

🌈 Performing the queries

To complete the objectives we have performed ten queries.
